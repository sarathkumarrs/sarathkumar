I strongly believe that constant learning is a part of our journey, and if at some point one stops the process, that person is out of the game. My constant learning in both horizontal and vertical dimensions has landed me some of the best opportunities I could have ever dreamt of, in the last few years. Coming from a strong tech background, spending most of my time learning and teaching code, I found another vertical of mine which was to do marketing and become an influencer. Currently, I have more than 100k followers on Instagram, a top blogger tag on Quora, and a highly engaging audience on LinkedIn.

Spending almost four years into machine learning and artificial intelligence, teaching and assisting more than 500 students, winning three hackathons, and giving a lot of talks, I stepped into research where I published 3 research papers. I am a researcher turned Entrepreneur as after continuing my research for 18 months, I thought of a product around it and presented it to the audience. My research revolves around AI psychology and multimodal analysis of data.

Social media is a tool you can use to leverage your digital identity, an identity on which only you have the control. I am a product of digital identity and strongly believe in creating an online presence.
